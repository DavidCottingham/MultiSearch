# MultiSearch
MultiSearch searches multiple websites given a single search term.
The user creates categories and adds search URLs to them before searching with the commands "addcategory" and "addurl".
The URLs must contain "%s" where the serach terms should be inserted.
The script can be run with command-line arguments and run only once - useful for a quick search, or run without command-line arguments to run in a loop such that the user can run multiple commands before exiting - useful for adding many categories and URLs such as on the first run.
Use the command "help" for a printout of available commands and a short description of each.
